        <h1><span style="color: #1abc9c; font-size: 4.5rem;">Nature Of Horton Plains</span></h1>
      </center>
      <p>Horton Plains in Sri Lanka, is the coldest and windiest location in the country. It consists of ecosystems such
        as
        Montane evergreen forests, grasslands, marshy lands and aquatic ecosystem. At an altitude of 2,100 meters above
        sea level, Horton Plains spreads across over 3,169 hectares of the highest tableland of the island. In view of
        the large number of endemic flora and fauna species, Horton Plains was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site on
        30th July 2010. Plains, its surroundings, forests and the adjoining Peak Wilderness constitute Sri Lanka’s most
        important
        catchment area of almost all major rivers. The plains are also of outstanding scenic beauty and conservation
        importance, containing most of the habitats and endemic plants and animals representative of the country’s wet
        and Montane zones. The western slopes support the most extensive area of Montane cloud forest surviving in the
        island. Horton Plains is not merely a destination for nature tourists. Since the rich biodiversity of Horton
        Plains is still grossly underexplored, it affords invaluable opportunities to those engaged on educational and
        research activities. Protecting Horton Plains is a call of duty for all Sri Lankans.
        <img src="Images\nature_1.jpg" style="float:left; width:50%; padding: 10px; border-radius:1rem; padding: 10px;">
        <br><br>Climate of Horton Plains is that of a wet Montane forest. The average annual temperature of 14-16⁰
        Centigrade while the humidity is relatively low at 65%. Though annual rainfall of the highlands is about 2540mm,
        Horton Plains records over 5000 mm of rainfall annually.During the dry season, the temperature drops to around
        5⁰ Centigrade in the day time. Swept with strong gale
        force winds at times, over-night frost is fairly common.
        The gently rolling plateau of Horton Plains at the southern end of the central Montane massif of Sri Lanka is
        interspersed with net work of streams and channels. The Montane forest is also the source of three major rivers
        of Sri Lanka: River Mahaweli-the longest river of Sri Lanka, River Walave and River Kelani. Still more, Horton
        Plains is bounded by the country’s second and third highest mountain peaks of Sri Lanka: Mount Kirigalpotta
        Kanda (2389 m) and Mount Thotupola Kanda (2357 m). The escarpment with a depth of 900 meters called World’s End
        and Baker’s Falls is one of the highlights of the Horton Plains.</p>
      <br>

      <br>
      <h2>Location of Horton Plains</h2>
      <br>

      <p> Plains is spread over the southern ridge of the central highlands in between Nuwara Eliya and Haputale. The
        tourists approaching Horton Plains from Nuwara Eliya find an entrance point at Pattipola while those approaching
        from Haputale find an entrance point at Ohiya. Three kilometers drive from either entrance leads to the newly
        built visitors center. Visitors center exhibits interesting displays on the history of flora and fauna of Horton
        Plains.</p>
      <br>

      <h2>World’s End in Horton Plains in Sri Lanka</h2>
      <br>

      <p>On the southern edge of the Horton Plains at an altitude of 2140m is famous World’s End, an escarpment that
        fall sheer 900 meters. The man-made modern irrigation reservoir contained within the national park of Udawalawe
        brings in a lovely view of the low lying plains of the southern Sri Lanka. On a clear morning the World’s End
        affords the view running to the southern coast of Sri Lanka. The panoramic and distant views are bound to get
        obscured by the mist from around 10am onwards. As such an early morning arrival at the escarpment would stand in
        good stead. Especially in the rainy months of May to July, the mist is particularly thick.</p>

        <h1><span style="color: #1abc9c; font-size: 4.5rem;">Wild Of Horton Plains</span></h1>
      </center>
      <br>

      <p>The most frequent site of wildlife at Horton Plains are herds of Sambar Deer. Among the other mammals in the
        park are Strip-necked Mongoose, Long-tailed Giant Squirrel Wild Boar, the endemic Bear Monkey and Toque Monkey,
        Fishing cat, Otter and

        All of the Montane endemics of Sri Lanka are found in Horton Plains. Sri Lanka bush warbler, Dull-Blue
        flycatcher, Sri Lanka whistling thrush and the yellow-eared bulbul, Sri Lanka Wood Pigeon, Sri Lanka
        White-eye, Spot-winged Thrush, Dull-blue Flycatcher, Sri Lanka Bush Warbler, Scaly Thrush, Sri Lanka Whistling
        Thrush, Brown-capped Babbler, Sri Lanka Spur-fowl and Sri Lanka Jungle-fowl. Other highlights are the
        Himalayan migrants Pied Thrush, Kashmir Flycatcher Indian Pitta. Black Bird, Mountain Hawk Eagle, Black Eagle,
        Jerdon’s Baza, Pied Bushchat, Hill Swallow and Hill Munia.
        <br><br> <img src="Images\wild_1.jpg" style="float:right; width:50%; padding: 10px; border-radius:1rem; padding: 10px;">
        Now the Horton Plains has become a happy field of herds of Sambar Deer. However the growth population of
        Sambar Deer has resulted in the increase of number of Leopards. Wild Boar, the endemic Bear Monkey and Toque
        Monkey, Slender Loris, Fishing cat, Otter, Barking deer, Strip-necked Mongoose, Long-tailed Giant Squirrel are
        some of the other mammals found here.

        Until a century ago, Horton Plains was rich with Elephants. Then the whole population was hunted down to
        extinction by the British colonialists in Sri Lanka then called Ceylon. Today Horton Plains is the only
        national park in Sri Lanka where elephants aren’t seen at all.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>A Whole New Species: Horton Plains slender loris</h2>
      <br>

      <p> Plains slender loris was discovered in 1937. However since then there haven’t been recorded sightings at all
        in Horton Plains. The diminutive primate has been presumed extinct. In 2002 a fleeting nighttime sighting of
        something looking like the elusive tree-dweller, however, gave conservationists hope. Follow-up surveys led by
        the Zoological Society of London finally confirmed the lorises are alive-if not exactly well-in 2009, when two
        individuals were photographed and examined. The Horton Plains slender loris is generally classified as a
        subspecies of Sri Lanka’s red slender loris. But, thanks in part to the first ever pictures, researchers now
        believe the Horton Plains slender loris could be a whole new species!</p>
